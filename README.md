# In Progress
# Long Term
- pattern scan database
- file format parsing
- Windows API/Syscall scanner
- Program Digraph
- Yara Rule Scanner
- Python3 scripting

# To DO
- Add filtering algorithm for file browser
- Fix Progress Bar for Byte scanner
- Dynamic file loading based on offset, need to only load so many bytes at a time so we can handle large files(currently crash around 5mb)
- Global offset - currently two different offset for Hexdump and opcode viewer
